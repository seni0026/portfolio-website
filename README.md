## Process
### 1. **Planning and Structure**
Before diving into development, I outlined the structure of the website to ensure it would be intuitive and easy to navigate. The site is divided into key sections:
- **About Me**: A brief introduction to who I am and my philosophy as a developer and designer.
- **Skills**: A showcase of my technical expertise and tools I use.
- **Projects**: A portfolio of my best work, with links to full website and GitHub repositories.
- **Contact**: A simple and accessible way for visitors to get in touch with me.

### 2. **Design Choices**
The design of the website is inspired by modern web design principles:
- **Typography**: I used the "Inter" font for clean, readable text and "Fraunces" for headings to add a touch of elegance and creativity.
- **Color Palette**: A dark, professional theme with accents of teal and muted pink to create a vibrant yet sophisticated look.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations (fade-ins, hover effects and gradient) were added to enhance interactivity without overwhelming the user.
- **Responsiveness**: The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

### 3. **Development**
The development process involved writing clean to ensure maintainability and scalability. I used semantic HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
